# Agile Engine Transaction Manager

A microservice that exposes endpoints that allow managing transactions.

## API Documentation
API documentation is available through Swagger in the URL http://[host]:port/swagger-ui.html.
A summary of the API documentation follows:


### Installing and Running
To build the project (running the tests) run
```
./gradlew clean build
```

To start the microservice run:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

You can make requests from curl, Postman to the localhost and port specified (default is localhost:8080) but you can also access the API Documentation and make requests using the Swagger UI:
To access Swagger UI, in a browser enter the URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

To stop the microservice press Ctr + C in the terminal.

It is not necessary to provide an external database service since the microservice runs with its own in-memory HSQLDB database.
This can easily be changed by modyfying the property "url" in the file application.properties  with another jdbc url:
Initial SQL scripts are included unde resources/data.sql and are run automatically when the app starts.

To start the frontend go to src/main/frontend run for the first time:
```
npm install

```
To start the app run:

```
npm start

```
It will start the app at localhost:4200.
NOTE: In order to be able to test, CORS was disabled. The annotation @CrossOrigin(origins = {"http://localhost:4200"}) should be removed from the controller if this is going to be used in prod.
To stop the service run Ctr + C.


## Tests

As part of the run, tests are run automatically.
To run the backend tests only, run
```
./gradlew test
```

The project includes unit tests that can be found under the package "test" and integration tests that can be found under the "test/integration".
The Integration test included runs a complete cycle, posting a transaction, getting it by id, getting all the transactions and getting the balance.

Current coverage is 100% for class, 91% for methods and 88% for lines of code.

To run the frontend tests, go to src/main/frontend and run
```
npm test
```
